# Advanced-Programming
Advanced Programming Course Codes for Assignments, MSc in Computer Science at University of Copenhagen

## Assignment 0 Arithmetic expressions
> The text of the (main) assignment is the "Assignment 0 Arithmetic Expressions" document, and the supporting files (code.zip) are here.
The "warm-up" part of the assignment consists of (only) the "Touring Haskell" section of Exercise Set 0. The relevant stub files for this part are also included in the above zip file, given by the professor.

### Submission instructions:

> If you're not working in a group: Submit report.pdf and code.zip as described in the assignment text.
If you're working in a two-person group: First, you need to join an Absalon submission group. Select "People" from the left menu and go to the "Groups" tab. (Note that this may take a few seconds to load.) Find an empty group named 'AP20 Assignment 0 Groups N' (tagged as a member of the 'AP20 Assignment 0 Groups' set â€“ not one of the 'Student groups') and join it; your partner should do likewise. When you are ready to submit, double-check that you are both members of the group you agreed on, before one of you submits the required report.pdf and code.zip.
In either case, please make sure that your report.pdf prominently shows your KUid(s) on the first page. (We prefer that you not put your real names on the submission.) If you experience any trouble or oddities with the submission process, contact a TA, or ask for help on the discussion forum.
